The theme pays tribute to J.K. Rowling's iconic Harry Potter series, blending the enchantment of that magical universe with the creativity and innovation of programming. It's a nod to how coding brings us closer to our own kind of magic—crafting ideas into reality. And don’t worry, even if you’re not a fan of the series, you can still enjoy the spellbinding experience of programming through this project!",
